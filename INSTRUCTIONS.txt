Because I keep forgetting.

run.fsh - Does 'the stuff'. Currently this is creating all possible boards so we can get some counts

run_all_boards.fsh - Creates all possible boards and keeps count. (doesn't actually keep all of them on disk)


Create a board file from dropping into columns:
./bfcf -f file -c col0, col1, col2,...

Render a board file:
./bfcf -f file -a

Show generation counter:
./bfcf -f file -g

Generate next moves based on previous moves file:
./bfcf -f file -n [generate_option] (current options: 1, just generate any move, even if it leads to loss)
